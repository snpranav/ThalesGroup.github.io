Still, when your security team prevents your application from going into production due to a lack of data encryption \u2014 this can be very annoying.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at the different data encryption methods that are most commonly used and how we can implement some of them.\\n\\nData encrypted at-rest vs in-transit?\\n=====================================\\n\\nWell, it\u2019s often hard to choose between encrypting a complete Postgres database or encrypting only specific fields of data in the database right before it gets written to a table.\\n\\nThe key difference between the two is that encrypting a database **after** data is written to it is called **data encryption at rest** and encrypting data **before** data is written to a database is called data encryption **in-transit**.\\n\\nThe illustration below should give you a good high-level understanding of the difference. Although data encryption at-rest was a standard encryption practice followed for many years, it involves developers writing and maintaining various different scripts or applications to ensure that the encryption is up to company standards. It is still useful while encrypting file systems and storage. On the other hand, data encryption in-transit is a lot more beneficial at times when you want to make your infrastructure database agnostic and provide high-security standards with significantly low developer effort.\\n\\n![Data Encryption at REST Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*7sOyc7n62Mxsq0cfKsLL0Q.png)\\n\\nNote that from the above diagram we can see that the method of encrypting data in-transit uses a **side-car container** which is a proxy used to intercept every request with sensitive fields or encrypted data and encrypt or decrypt the same respectively.\\n\\n![Data Encryption in-transit Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*9PC9Nv4j_L2LIoWsR4ZIeg.png)\\n\\nAdvantages of Data Encryption in-Transit\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n**\u2705 No change to applications**\\n\\nThe beauty of doing data-encryption in transit is that you don\u2019t need to worry about changing any of your frontend apps, APIs, or databases. Since the side-car container does field-level encryption, you can granularly control all the data that needs to be encrypted and decrypted by remotely setting access policies from your key manager.\\n\\n**\u2705 Easy to deploy**\\n\\nDeploying a [Data Protection Gateway](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/ciphertrust-data-protection-gateway) side-car container is as easy to deploy as logging agents such as DataDog or Prometheus. You can just update your docker-compose, Kubernetes config files or just use Helm to install it.\\n\\n**\u2705 Developers can stop implementing data security policies**\\n\\nNow you can shift the responsibility of setting and implementing data security policies from developers over to InfoSec teams. This significantly helps prevent data breaches or unauthorized data access.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Data Encryption in-Transit\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n\u274c **Data encryption is only as strong as policies set**\\n\\nThis applies to any method of data encryption. However, when we perform field-level encryption and decryption, InfoSec teams need to be aware of all data flowing through various API routes to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to unencrypted data.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHow Do I Implement Data Encryption in-Transit?\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou\u2019re in luck \ud83d\ude4c because I have a tutorial showing you how to easily implement data encryption in-transit with any of your containerized applications.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, I have used [CipherTrust Manager](https://ciphertrust.io/)\u2019s Data Protection Gateway product which is extremely easy to set up and free to start using\ud83d\udc47\\n\\nimport YoutubeEmbed from \'@site/src/components/YoutubeEmbed\';\\nimport GroupButtons from \'@site/src/components/VideoButtons/GroupButtons\';\\n\\n<YoutubeEmbed embedId=\\"EJun5McPRGY\\" />\\n<GroupButtons href=\\"https://github.com/snpranav/data-encryption-in-transit-demo\\" demourl=\\"https://main-yak.sneakpeak.dev/\\" />\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow go ahead and encrypt data in-transit from all your applications using side-car containers.\\n\\nIf you have any issues with implementation or questions about data encryption in-transit, feel free to leave a comment, tweet [@snpranav](https://twitter.com/snpranav), or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/snpranav/data-encryption-in-transit-demo/issues/new) :)"}]}')}}]);
